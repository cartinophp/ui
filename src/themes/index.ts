/**
 * ============================================
 * CARTINO UI - THEMING SYSTEM
 * ============================================
 *
 * INTEGRATION GUIDE FOR COMPONENTS
 *
 * This theming system provides a complete, type-safe styling solution
 * using tailwind-variants with our custom color system.
 *
 * === STEP 1: IMPORT THE THEME ===
 * In your component's <script setup>:
 *
 *   import theme from '@/themes/your-component'
 *
 * === STEP 2: COMPUTE THE UI CLASSES ===
 * Create a computed property that applies the theme with your props:
 *
 *   const ui = computed(() => theme({
 *     variant: props.variant,
 *     color: props.color,
 *     size: props.size,
 *     disabled: props.disabled
 *   }))
 *
 * === STEP 3: APPLY TO TEMPLATE ===
 * Use the ui object in your template (supports slot-based theming):
 *
 *   <button :class="ui.base({ class: props.ui?.base })">
 *     <span :class="ui.label({ class: props.ui?.label })">
 *       {{ label }}
 *     </span>
 *   </button>
 *
 * === STEP 4: ALLOW UI CUSTOMIZATION ===
 * Accept a `ui` prop for component-level customization:
 *
 *   interface Props {
 *     // ... other props
 *     ui?: Record<string, any>
 *   }
 *
 * === AVAILABLE COLOR TOKENS ===
 * Use these in your themes for consistent, accessible colors:
 *
 * Primary Colors:
 *   - primary, primary-foreground
 *   - secondary, secondary-foreground
 *
 * Semantic Colors:
 *   - success, success-foreground
 *   - warning, warning-foreground
 *   - error/destructive, error-foreground
 *   - info, info-foreground
 *
 * Neutral Colors:
 *   - background, foreground
 *   - default, elevated
 *   - muted, muted-foreground
 *   - accent, accent-foreground
 *   - card, card-foreground
 *
 * Borders & Interactive:
 *   - border, input, ring
 *   - highlighted (primary text)
 *
 * All colors support light/dark mode automatically!
 *
 * === EXAMPLE USAGE ===
 * See Button.vue and Radio.vue for complete examples.
 *
 * === CREATING NEW THEMES ===
 * 1. Copy src/themes/_template.ts
 * 2. Rename it to your component name
 * 3. Define slots for each element
 * 4. Add variants (size, color, variant, states)
 * 5. Use compoundVariants for complex combinations
 * 6. Set defaultVariants
 * 7. Export the theme
